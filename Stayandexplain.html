<h1> Setting: </h1>
<p> There is a fence that surronds what one may call a small city or town. It is
  somewhat hard to look inside of in some parts but ultimately if you look hard
  enough, you can see other people in there. Once in the throne, you can see what
  seems to be a great place for the person in command. The person in command in this
  case is a woman. She sits on her throne as if showing herself as the leader, yet
  she talks gentle in a manner that allows one to trust her.

<h1> Plot: </h1>
<p> You go back to where the fence was. There is a wild amount of people surrounding
    the entrance. You slowly walk up to it and are then escorted by several men and
    women. They drop you off in the front of a throne where you are left in front
    of what you can only assume to be these peoples&rsquo; leader. The leader is a woman
    who appears to be about 40 years old. She explains how they have not encountered
    any strangers in a long time. She seems nice, but is clearly also trying to
    intimidate you so that you do not make any stupid decisions while in her home.
    You slowly get into a conversation which leads to another and so forth. This
    talk is very extensive and start to wonder if you can stay here. You decided it is
    time to either stay and abandon your past life, your warehouse etc. or if you
    should go back home and kindly decline any offers meant to keep you here. You
    might even consider going to talk to the man in the coat again.
