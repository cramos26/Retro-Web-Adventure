<h1> Setting: </h1>
<p> Down the street of the warehouse. What once was a street separating the
  sidewalks with a road in the middle, is now a hybrid of broken down concrete
  and plenty of vegetation. The vegetation provides cover for your investigation,
  allowing you to avoid being seen.  </p>

<h1> Plot: </h1>
<p> As you walk out of the warehouse, you make sure to avoid making noise. Going
  alone isn’t the smartest thing that you have done, and knowing so, you make
  sure to bring your revolver. You only have 3 bullets and acquiring ammo would
  be nearly impossible, yet you still decide to go. When finally out, you follow
   this individual for about a mile. Little by little it becomes dark, and you
   need to reduce the amount of distance that you give this perp or else you
   might lose him. A few hundred yards in distance becomes a few hundred feet.
   Then you notice that the person finally stops. He takes a deep breath, then
   without warning, starts charging towards you. He gets you by surprise. You
   freeze up and don’t know what to do. Your first instinct is to run. You run
   towards a rocky path in an attempt to get the assailant to give up, but it
   only slows him down. After running for a few minutes you go down a path that
   can only be described as incredibly rocky and steep. While going down the
   path, you notice smoke coming from one direction. It is barely noticeable.
   You think about heading there in search for assistance. You also remember
   that you have your revolver.  </p>
