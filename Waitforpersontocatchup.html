<h1> Setting: </h1>
<p> You are in the middle of a path ridden in plants, dirt, and rocks. The sky
    is getting pretty dark. You are surrounded by what can be described as boulders
    which eliminate some alternative roads for escape. </p>

<h1> Plot: </h1>
<p> You chose to let him or her catch up. While letting him or her to catch up,
  you allow yourself to seem powerless. You do not want to withdraw your weapon
  so suddenly. Your heart is pounding and you cannot help but break a sweat.
  You find out that this is a bad idea and look around for other alternatives.
  3 bullets are not enough. Even if you were to make all the shots, what would
  even guarantee that wild animals will not finish you, or that you will even find
  your way back home while so dark? You decide that it is better to either run
  away and try to lose the scythe stranger, or to run towards the smoke you
  spotted a while back in search of help. </p>
