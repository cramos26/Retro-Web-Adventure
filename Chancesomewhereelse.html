<h1> Setting: </h1>
<p> You are out in the wilderness near your home or atleast you think so. It is
  hard to tell with everything that is going through your mind. It is very blurry.
  You look out and there is a dark figure in front of you. You hesitate and then
  can only focus on him. Your tunnel vision blocks everything else.

<h1> Plot: </h1>
<p>
You chose to take your chances elsewhere. You are confused as to how there has
been plenty of people in a small cluster close to your home without knowing it.
You eventually have a great distance between you and the fence and you decide
it's better to stop thinking about it and raise your speed to get home.
As your thoughts stop, you cannot believe your mind. Once again, in front of you
is the dark figure. He is clearly hurt and won't be able to wield his scythe properly.
You cannot keep going. It ultimately ends with you two face to face. At first there is
some tension. Slowly but gradually, you both lower your weapons. It is clear that
you both cannot keep this going. You decide to ask why the hostility. Slowly you converse
and realize that you too are lone wolves, you have no one else. You only wanted to know
what was going on around you. You both did not mean to harm the other, or at least
at first. He seems sincere. You don't know whether you should trust this man because
he seems sincere or if your judgement is being interrupted by your fatigue. The
man offers help, but you are obviously hesistant. Do you accept his help, or do you
reject it and leave as soon as you are able to? </p>
<h1 class="blink"> Decisions: </h1>
<a href="Stayandexplain.html"> Avoid his help and go back home when able to;
  possibly go back to the fence </a>
<p> <a href="Bonding.html"> Accept his help </a></p>
