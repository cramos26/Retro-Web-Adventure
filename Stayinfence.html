<h1> Setting: </h1>
<p> The hills are downhill sloping and there are rocky patches on this road. It
  is fairly dark and hard to see up ahead. All the trails and roads look the
  same. There are several patches of tall trees and bushes that make camouflage
  an ease. In the distance there is a slight grey contrast in the sky. It appears
  to be smoke. </p>

<h1> Plot: </h1>
<p> You have decided to stay in the society within the fence. The people were a
    bit hesitant at first, but they have come to accept you as one of their own.
    You have never seen so many peoplee together, united. Everyone follows the
    laws put into place. Everyone respects everyone. It is crazy lucky that this
    series of unfortunate events has led to happiness. You live here for many years
    and meet your lover. You end up having kids. Life is beautiful.
