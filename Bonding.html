<h1> Setting: </h1>
<p> You are out in a campfire. You are right next to the man you at one point tried
  to kill. There is a light breeze in the air. There isn't any tension. The warmth
  of the fire caresses your face, and your mind is put at ease.

<h1> Ending: </h1>
<p> Eventually you talk with the man in the black coat. You find out that he has been alone for
    for a very long time. You triggered his fight or flight response, which ultimately
    left you both in a sticky situation. It is amazing how friendly the man with the scythe
    is. Underneath that scythe is a caring man. He has not been accompanied by someone
    in a long time. You both eventually agree to stick together for a while. This
    little agreement leads to many years of friendship. You care for one another, and
    up until you are separated by death, you have never once more been alone.</p>
