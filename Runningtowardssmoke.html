<h1> Setting: </h1>
<p> The hills are downhill sloping and there are rocky patches on this road. It
  is fairly dark and hard to see up ahead. Only the smoke is visible up ahead.
  The only noise comes from you and the person chasing you. Twigs snap and break
  and you can feel the adrenaline in your body kick in. You try your best to
  lose the person in the dark coat, but he keeps gaining close and closer on
  your tail.</p>

<h1> Plot: </h1>
<p> You are running towards the smoke. You go through trees after trees after
  trees. It seems like there is no end. Suddenly you start to notice a change
  in scenery. There isn’t that many trees which is clearly the doing of others.
  You run for another few hundred yards and notice that there is what appears
  to be some sort of fence up ahead. You start to scream at the top of your
  lungs for help. You then start to lose speed and feel the figure in back of
  you close in on you. When finally up to the fence, you are surrounded by the
  figure. The figure gets closer and you can clearly see that it is a man. A man
  with a scar on his left cheek. You have no choice but to draw your weapon. You
  warn him to back off, but he just won’t. The look in his eye is terrifying; it
  is clearly going to end in a dead body. You raise your gun and turn your head
  away as you shoot. When you look back it is clear that he didn’t think you
  would shoot. He grunts as you cock back your gun once more. This time, there
  is a hesitation on his part. He has been shot on his arm. You cannot tell
  exactly where but notice that he is carrying his scythe in the opposite arm
  now. Then there is what you can only assume is a mob of people coming with
  torches. The man in the black coat flees immediately. You run a little as well
  but you can’t decide whether if you want to go back and explain what your
  situation is, or if you can handle yourself now that your assailant has fled.
  It is dark and you must make a choice quickly.  </p>
