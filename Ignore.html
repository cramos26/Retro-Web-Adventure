<h1> Setting: </h1>
<p> The hills are downhill sloping and there are rocky patches on this road. It
  is fairly dark and hard to see up ahead. All the trails and roads look the
  same. There are several patches of tall trees and bushes that make camouflage
  an ease. In the distance there is a slight grey contrast in the sky. It appears
  to be smoke. </p>

<h1> Plot: </h1>
<p> When you exit the warehouse, you bring along your revolver. Weapons as such
   are extremely valuable and hard to come by. The downfall: you only have 3
   bullets. You bring your blade just in case. Once going outside you notice
   that itâ€™ll be dark soon. You bring your night equipment which consists of a
   flashlight that is powered by turning a crank. You walk the way of where the
   scythe individual came from. You walk for what seems to be hours when you
   decide to walk back. It has been a while since you have been outside at night.
   You question whether if you are on the correct path. Out of the corner of
   your eyes you spot a grey patch in the air. There appears to be smoke a small
   distance ahead. You think about exploring this before you try and head back.
   Suddenly you hear twigs crunch. You look up. It is the person in the black
   coat. The individual is slowly walking towards you. You have to decide between
   waiting for the scythe holder to approach you withing shooting distance in order
   to be effective with your revolver, or to run towards the smoke in hopes of
   help. </p>
