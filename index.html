<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p> The world is not what it used to be. 2025 marks the year when WWIII broke
  out. WWIII was nothing like any war before. The devastation that was brought
  along is unimaginable. Food is starting to become scarce, and incredibly hard
  to find. The world is now mainly filled with murderers and cannibals. Everyone
  is out for themselves. Trust no one. </p>
<h1> Setting: </h1>
<p> The year is 2046. You are inside an abandoned warehouse, which you have come
  to name your home. Wood is covering all the broken windows and reduces the
  amount of light entering the room. It is about to get dark. </p>

<h1> Plot: </h1>
<p> You wake up to the sound of an eerie screech. The sound of metal scraping
  concrete and metal along its path gets louder and louder by the second. You
  get up in a flash and sigh in relief when you discover that the sound is
  coming from the outside. You get to the nearest window and peep outside. You
  catch a dark figure in a black coat dragging a scythe and heading down the
  street. You have not seen another person in weeks. You decide whether if it
  is necessary to investigate who this person is, and what they are doing near
  your home. </p>
